                'We had started on a journey to convert our waste into biofuel in 2018 with digesters. The idea was to use a biodigester toilet system that operates on an anaerobic digestive process to break down and clean toilet waste. We were unsuccessful with this venture due to a lack of financing. We needed an expert to help us set up the digesters effectively, and we could not afford the associated cost.\n\nA second attempt to make use of the waste was to set up a sewer treatment plant, in 2019. Our hope was to create a closed loop that would break down most of the waste into water that would then be recycled back into the toilet system and sludge that could act an as an agricultural input. We experienced unprecedented amounts of electricity load shedding between 2019 and 2021 which affected the effectiveness of the sewer treatment plant we procured in 2019. We did not have the financial capacity to procure the solar equipment needed to successfully commission the venture.\n\nWe are currently in a fundraising round, hopeful for sufficient financing to commission sewer treatment plants on every new facility we construct. We are also exploring adapting new technology that could add to our revenue model such as HydroThermal Carbonization (HTC) to produce hydrochar which has been largely coined the NEW charcoal.',
